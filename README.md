# Credit Card Risk
## Overview: Purpose Definition
Within the challenge, our goal is to develop a statistical model which is capable to classify loans as safe or fradulent. In other words we are confronted to binary classification problem.
In the search for the most suitible model we will first deploy logistic regression model and, afterwards try out ensemble learning approach for the better results.

## Logistic regression
### Data preperation
After remove missing values from the initial dataset ([LoanStats_2019Q1.csv.zip](https://github.com/ArmineKhanan/Credit_risk/tree/main/Resources)), we are going to leverage a labeled set of 68817 records. The models will be trained on 75% of data and be tested on the rest 25%.

### Naive Random Oversampling
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. That's why we will implement resempling techniques first. The first resampling strategy implemented is naive random oversampling, the results of which are presented below:

The balanced accuracy score, ranging from 0 to 1, indicates the fairness of the classification model. 0.62 is a moderate result and urges to seek better solutions. The other measure worth our attention is the low recall rate for high-risk loans: 58%.

### Other resampling techniques
To yield better results we tried out few more resampling solutions like:
*Synthetic Minority Oversampling
*Cluster Centroids Undersampling
*Combination over- and under-sampling: SMOTEENN algorithm

Though alternative resampling strategies increased neither the balanced accuracy score nor the recall rate for high-risk loans of the logistic regression model sufficiently. Ultemately we went for Ensemble Learning algorithms.
